# InformationSecurity-First_Project

The project is done on the "Information Security" subject, first semester Master's studies

## Project name: Encryption of images with ECB and CBC mode using TEA(Tiny Encryption Algorithm)

This project implements Tiny Encyption Algorithm with two modes of operation: ECB mode and CBC mode
 It includes changes with and without UI implementation. 
 - Without UI we set the path of the files on our code, and using UI we can upload the file from whatever path on our computer

From the results it is known that CBC mode is more secure than ECB mode
